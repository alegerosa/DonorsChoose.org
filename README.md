## DonorsChoose.org
This is an analysis of donation data from DonorsChoose.org, using a dataset released in Kaggle.

The data files can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/donorschoose/io

The script assumes that you have the .csv files in a 'data' directory within the project. (To achieve this, clone the project and create a 'data' folder within it, download the data from Kaggle, and unzip the .csv files into 'data')
